# Smart App Rate

Smart app rate dialog for Android which takes user rating into consideration. If the user rates the app below the defined threshold rating, the dialog will change into a feedback form. Otherwise, It will take the user to the
Google PlayStore.

## Features
- Auto fetches the app icon to appear on top of the dialog
- Make the dialog appear on a defined app session
- Opens Feedback form if the user rates below the minimum threshold
- Extracts the accent color from your app's theme
- Customizable title, positive button and negative button texts
- Customizable button colors and backgrounds
- Override dialog redirection to Google Play or Feedback form according to your needs

If you want the dialog to appear on the Nth session of the app, just add the `session(N)` to the dialog builder method
 and move the code to the `onCreate()` method of your Activity class. The dialog will appear when the app is opened for the Nth time.

## How to use

Use the dialog as it is

```java

final RatingDialog ratingDialog = new RatingDialog.Builder(this)
                .threshold(3)
                .session(7)
                .onRatingBarFormSumbit(new RatingDialog.Builder.RatingDialogFormListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onFormSubmitted(String feedback) {

                    }
                }).build();

        ratingDialog.show();

```

or use the dialog builder class to customize the rating dialog to match your app's UI.

```java
final RatingDialog ratingDialog = new RatingDialog.Builder(this)
                        .icon(drawable)
                        .session(7)
                        .threshold(3)
                        .title("How was your experience with us?")
                        .titleTextColor(R.color.black)
                        .positiveButtonText("Not Now")
                        .negativeButtonText("Never")
                        .positiveButtonTextColor(R.color.white)
                        .negativeButtonTextColor(R.color.grey_500)
                        .formTitle("Submit Feedback")
                        .formHint("Tell us where we can improve")
                        .formSubmitText("Submit")
                        .formCancelText("Cancel")
                        .ratingBarColor(R.color.yellow)
                        .playstoreUrl("YOUR_URL")
                        .onThresholdCleared(new RatingDialog.Builder.RatingThresholdClearedListener() {
                                           @Override
                                           public void onThresholdCleared(RatingDialog ratingDialog, float rating, boolean thresholdCleared) {
                                               //do something
                                               ratingDialog.dismiss();
                                           }
                                       })
                        .onThresholdFailed(new RatingDialog.Builder.RatingThresholdFailedListener() {
                                           @Override
                                           public void onThresholdFailed(RatingDialog ratingDialog, float rating, boolean thresholdCleared) {
                                               //do something
                                               ratingDialog.dismiss();
                                           }
                                       })
                        .onRatingChanged(new RatingDialog.Builder.RatingDialogListener() {
                                            @Override
                                            public void onRatingSelected(float rating, boolean thresholdCleared) {

                                            }
                                       })
                        .onRatingBarFormSumbit(new RatingDialog.Builder.RatingDialogFormListener() {
                            @Override
                            public void onFormSubmitted(String feedback) {

                            }
                        }).build();

                ratingDialog.show();
```

### Note
* Don't use `session()` if you want to show the dialog on a click event.
* Remove the `threshold()` from the builder if you don't want to show the feedback form to the user.
* Use `onThresholdCleared()` to override the default redirection to Google Play.
* Use `onThresholdFailed()` to show your custom feedback form.

## Installation

### Gradle
Add it as a dependency in your app's build.gradle file

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.codemybrainsout.rating:ratingdialog:1.0.8'
}
```
